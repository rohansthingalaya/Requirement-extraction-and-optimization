# Requirement-extraction-and-optimization

The project extracts requirement candidates from a document using spaCy and are put in meaningful groups with the help of Latent Direchlet Allocation algorithm.
"Requirement and structure optimization notebook.ipynb" is a jupyter notebook file with step by step data analysis and visualization. Topic coherence is implemented in the jupyter notebook.
Jupyter notebook also has a implementation of LDA Mallet which can be downloaded from the below link and the paths have to be updated in the code (also described in the code).
